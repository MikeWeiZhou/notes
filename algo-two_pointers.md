# Algo: Two Pointers

Problems where we deal with sorted arrays and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints are perfect for Two pointers pattern. Set of elements could be a pair, triplet, or even subarray.

## Pattern
This pattern is very diverse in implementation. Can have two pointers at start and end of an array and meeting in the middle, from the middle traversing outwards, or both from the beginning. Can even extract individual components into it's own loops, such as with max-min problems.
